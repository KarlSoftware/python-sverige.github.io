                We are delighted to announce an advanced Python one-day workshop run by
                Mike Müller of Python Academy.
                Mike has been teaching Python for about twelve years.
                Mike taught about 250 Python classes with well over 600 training days.
            </p>
            <h2>Intended Audience</h2>
            <p>
                The workshop is for intermediate Python programmers who would like to make it
                onto the advanced level. Learn how to take full advantage of this powerful
                language.
            </p>
            <h2>Course Content</h2>
            <p>
                Python offers several advanced concepts. It is possible to write useful Python
                programs without them. But if you want to really understand how Python works
                and how to write really pythonic programs, you should know about these topics:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Comprehensions</li>
                <li>Iterators and generators</li>
                <li>Context managers</li>
                <li>Decorators</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The workshop covers them in detail using code examples that will be immediately
                useful for your daily work. Carefully crafted exercises help you to experience
                the learned material. You will get detailed solutions for all exercises after
                the training.
                The workshop content and teaching concept is based on numerous advanced Python
                classes taught by Mike Müller including in-house courses and the successful
                courses at EuroPython 2012 and 2013, PyConPL 2012, PyCon DE 2013, PyCon IE 2013
                and 2014 as well as PyCon in Montrèal 2014 and 2015.
