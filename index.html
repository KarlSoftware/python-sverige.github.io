            <ul class="list-unstyled">
              <li><a name="thiderman"></a><h3>From Python to Go</h3><p>Lowe Thiderman</p><p>Audience level: Intermediate</p><p>My outline of the programming language journey true hipsters did three years ago; moving from Python to Go.</p></li>
              <li><a name="whittle"></a><h3>Performance Testing for Modern Apps</h3><p>Dustin Whittle</p><p>Audience level: Intermediate</p><p>Dustin Whittle shares the latest techniques and tools for performance testing modern web and mobile applications. Join this session and learn how to capacity plan and evaluate performance and the scalability of the server-side through Siege, Bees with Machine Guns, and Locust.io. We will dive into modern performance testing on the client-side and how to leverage navigation/resource timing apis and tools like Google PageSpeed and SiteSpeed.io to understand the real world performance of your users.</p></li>
              <li><a name="hagerty"></a><h3>Urban Legends: What You Code Makes You Who You Are</h3><p>PJ Hagerty</p><p>Audience level: Novice</p><p>Tools are just a means to an end.  So why do developers think the language they use defines the problems they solve. This talk will take a look at misconceptions across the board, some experiences, both positive and negative, people have had crossing barriers to new languages, and show some of the benefits thinking of one's self as a coder and not a "Ruby coder" or a "Python dev" can have on being a better problem solver.</p></li>
              <li><a name="berman"></a><h3>Introduction to JSON Schema</h3><p>Julian Berman</p><p>Audience level: Intermediate</p><p>JSON Schema is an increasingly popular, cross-language specification for schematization of JSON documents. It represents schema constraints on a JSON document *as* a JSON document, in a flexible validation language. We'll investigate some simple (and not so simple) examples of data validation using the `jsonschema` Python package, which implements the specification.</p></li>
              <li><a name="sauerbier"></a><h3>Big, complex, and noisy – sounds like fun! (analyzing and visualizing data for Life Sciences)</h3><p>Audience level: Intermediate</p><p>Marcel Sauerbier</p><p>Simple python modules such as matplotlib, NumPy & SciPy provide an awesome (comprehensible and comprehensive) framework for the analysis and visualization of big, complex and noisy data in life sciences. Analyzing hundreds of thousands of sequences generated from a single sequenced cell helps in understanding human development and disease.</p></li>
              <li><a name="shafik"></a><h3>HTTP/2 and Asynchronous APIs</h3><p>Davey Shafik</p><p>Audience level: Advanced</p><p>HTTP/2 (H2) is coming, and along with it a whole new way of communicating over the web. Connection re-use, prioritization, multiplexing, and server push are just some of the features we'll look at in H2</p></li>
              <li><a name="ljungmark"></a><h3>Eliminating application passwords using TLS</h3><p>D.S. Ljungmark</p><p>Audience level: Advanced</p><p>We will walk through setting up an x509 CA using Caramel and building a small, micro service setup, all using TLS certificates for authentication. There will also be an introduction to TLS and x509 and PKI systems in general.</p></li>
              <li><a name="ljungmark"></a><h3>Introduction to Crypto, TLS, PKI and x509</h3><p>D.S. Ljungmark</p><p>Audience level: Novice</p><p>I'll walk through the basics of Cryptography, an up high view of TLS and x509, and then delve down into setting it up with Let's Encrypt domain validation and a Python microservice.</p></li>
              <li><a name="mosyagin"></a><h3>Python in science: A case study</h3><p>Igor Mosyagin</p><p>Audience level: Novice</p><p>A short introduction on python adoption in scientific community given from the perspective of a PhD student in theoretical physics. Inevitably segueing towards why and how we should influence the current state.</p></li>
              <li><a name="blidh"></a><h3>The Point of Pointless Projects</h3><p>Henrik Blidh</p><p>Audience level: Intermediate</p><p>Does your spare time coding projects haunt your every waking moment? Have they grown beyond all reasonable boundaries? This is a talk about a three-year odyssey into spare time Python coding, focusing on unexpected but beneficial spin-offs that seemingly meaningless projects can have; from Sudoku solvers to Raspberry Pi prototypes.</p></li>
              <li><a name="rehn"></a><h3>Deep Python learning with Tensorflow - a data-driven approach to Python execution</h3><p>Erik Rehn</p><p>Audience level: Intermediate</p><p>Is it possible to train a neural network to execute Python scripts? Data-driven algorithm learning is a growing field of research. In this talk we will take a look at Google’s new deep learning library Tensorflow, and implement a basic model that can be taught how to execute simple Python scripts.</p></li>
              <li><a name="hagander"></a><h3>Enhancing your Python database experience with PostgreSQL</h3><p>Magnus Hagander</p><p>Audience level: Advanced</p><p>Python is a great programming language, and PostgreSQL is a great database. That's an overlap too good not to exploit! This talk will give an overview of how to use some of the PostgreSQL specific extensions in Python, to make your applications both easier and more powerful.</p></li>
              <li><a name="karlsson"></a><h3>Guided by Tests: What your unit tests can tell about your design</h3><p>Joakim Karlsson</p><p>Audience level: Advanced</p><p>We'll explore how our unit tests changed our design to become more adaptable once we started to listen to what they had to say. We'll go through a couple of functions and their tests and show how we step by step transformed them into something a lot easier to handle.</p></li>
              <li><a name="hoikkala"></a><h3>Let's Encrypt and the challenges with wildly heterogenous deployment environments</h3><p>Joona Hoikkala</p><p>Audience level: Novice</p><p>Introducing project called Let's Encrypt, it's ambitious mission to encrypt all the web and some of the challenges met in the first months of the public beta. Geared towards devops.</p></li>
              <li><a name="sibai"></a><h3>No need to spark when you can dask</h3><p>Eyad Sibai</p><p>Audience level: Advanced</p><p>In this talk we cover the what, the how and the why of Dask. we discuss the design behind dask which is blocking algorithms and task scheduling. Show examples of dask collections and how to use them. Compare dask to other alternatives.</p></li>
              <li><a name="barbans"></a><h3>Luigi, task orchestrator and workflow definition language in Python</h3><p>Uldis Barbans</p><p>Audience level: Intermediate</p><p>Luigi, github.com/spotify/luigi, has matured and orchestrates 50000+ interdependent batch processing invocations daily. Still its installation is as simple as `pip install`.Learning how to use an orchestrator to remove boilerplate from recurring important processes makes life great fun. It also makes Spotify data infrastructure move to Google Cloud Platform possible.</p></li>
